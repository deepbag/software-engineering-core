## ðŸ”¹ BankAccount Class Practice â€“ Java

### âœ… Problem Statement

Create a class called `BankAccount` with the following properties:

- `accountNumber` (String)
- `accountHolderName` (String)
- `balance` (double)

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:

1. Make all properties **private** (Encapsulation).
2. Provide **getter and setter** methods for each property.
3. Add validation logic:
    - The balance cannot be negative.
    - The account number must be exactly 10 digits.
4. Create a method `deposit(double amount)` that adds to the balance.
5. Create a method `withdraw(double amount)` that deducts from the balance only if thereâ€™s enough money.
6. In the `main` method, create an object and test deposit, withdraw, and validation logic.
