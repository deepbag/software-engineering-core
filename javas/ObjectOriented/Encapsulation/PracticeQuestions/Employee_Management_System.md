## ðŸ”¹ Employee Management System â€“ Java

### âœ… Problem Statement

Create a class named `Employee` that models a simplified employee information system. This class should securely store the employee's details and ensure that all the entered information is valid.

- `employeeName` (String): The full name of the employee.
- `employeeID` (String): A unique alphanumeric employee ID (e.g., "E12345").
- `salary` (double): The salary of the employee.
- `email` (String): The email address of the employee.
- `dateOfJoining` (String): The date of joining in `dd/mm/yyyy` format.

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements

1. All fields must be **private**.
2. Provide **public getters and setters** for each field.
3. Add **validations** in the setters:
    - `employeeID` must be **alphanumeric** and follow the pattern "E" followed by 5 digits (e.g., "E12345").
    - `salary` must be **positive**.
    - `email` must be in a valid **email format** (e.g., "user@example.com").
    - `dateOfJoining` must follow the **`dd/mm/yyyy`** format.
4. Create a method `isValidEmployee()` that:
    - Returns `true` only if **all fields are non-null** and **valid**.
    - Otherwise, prints appropriate error messages and returns `false`.
