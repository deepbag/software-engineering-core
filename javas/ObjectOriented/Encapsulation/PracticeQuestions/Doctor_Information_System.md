## ðŸ”¹ Doctor Information System â€“ Java

### âœ… Problem Statement

Create a class named `Doctor` that models a simplified doctor management system for a hospital. This class should securely store doctor details and validate the entered information.

- `doctorName` (String): Full name of the doctor.
- `doctorID` (String): Unique ID for the doctor (e.g., "D1023").
- `specialization` (String): Medical specialization (e.g., "Cardiologist", "Dermatologist").
- `experienceYears` (int): Number of years of medical experience.
- `contactNumber` (String): A 10-digit contact number.
- `email` (String): Official email address.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements

1. All fields must be **private**.
2. Provide **public getters and setters** for each field.
3. Add **validations** in the setters:
    - `doctorID` must start with `"D"` followed by 4 digits (e.g., "D1234").
    - `specialization` must not be empty.
    - `experienceYears` must be between **0 and 60**.
    - `contactNumber` must be **exactly 10 digits**.
    - `email` must follow a valid email format (e.g., ends with `@hospital.com`).
    - `doctorName` must not be empty.
4. Create a method `isValidDoctor()` that:
    - Returns `true` only if **all fields are non-null** and **valid**.
    - Otherwise, prints appropriate error messages and returns `false`.
