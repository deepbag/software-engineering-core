## ðŸ”¸ Inheritance Practice â€“ Java

### âœ… Problem Statement

Create a base class called `Person` with the following properties:

- `name` (String)
- `age` (int)

Then, create a derived class `Employee` that inherits from `Person` and adds:

- `employeeId` (int)
- `salary` (double)

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:

1. Create **constructors** in both classes to initialize the properties.
2. Add a method `displayDetails()` in both classes to print details.
3. In the `main` method, create **2 employee objects** and display their details.

```aiignore
Name: John
Age: 30
Employee ID: 101
Salary: 55000.0

Name: Sarah
Age: 28
Employee ID: 102
Salary: 62000.5
```
