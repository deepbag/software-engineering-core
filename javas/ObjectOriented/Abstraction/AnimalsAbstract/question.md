## ðŸ”¸ Abstraction â€“ Abstract Class â€“ Java

### âœ… Problem Statement

Create an abstract class called `Animal` with the following:

- An abstract method `makeSound()`
- A concrete method `sleep()` that prints `"Animal is sleeping..."`

Then, create two subclasses:

- `Dog` that implements `makeSound()` to print `"Dog barks"`
- `Cow` that implements `makeSound()` to print `"Cow moos"`

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:

1. Use **abstract class** and define at least one abstract method.
2. Implement the abstract method in all subclasses.
3. In the `main` method, create objects of `Dog` and `Cow`, call `makeSound()` and `sleep()` methods.

### ðŸ§  Sample Output:
```aiignore
Dog barks
Animal is sleeping...

Cow moos
Animal is sleeping...
```
